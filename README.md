## 📂 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects you can find on my GitHub:

## 🚀 Project Portfolio

* **🛠️🔄 [End-to-end MLOps with Databricks](https://github.com/Jakee4488/MLOps_Databricks_Project)**: This repository provides a simple, end-to-end MLOps architecture implemented within the Databricks platform. It includes a minimal, working machine learning project that demonstrates the key stages of an MLOps lifecycle, including data preparation, model training and tracking (using MLflow), model registration, and batch inference or serving.

* **🌿🔬 [CNN for Plant Disease Classification](https://github.com/Jakee4488/PlantDiseases_CNN_Classification)**: A production-ready MLOps system for classifying plant diseases (Healthy, Powdery, Rust) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project
transforms a research notebook into a scalable, reproducible, and automated machine learning pipeline.

* **🍄💻 [Mushroom Classification Analysis](https://github.com/Jakee4488/Mushroom_Prediction_ML_project)**: 🍄Mushroom Classification with MLOps. This repository contains a complete Python solution for classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using various Machine Learning algorithms. More importantly, it demonstrates how to transform an experimental ML model into a reliable, production-ready system through the adoption of MLOps principles.

* **🕸️ [Knowledge Graph RAG System](https://github.com/Jakee4488/Graphrag-flaskapp)**: Implementation of a GraphRAG system using a Flask application with the Ollama API and locally built models, leveraging graph-based structures for advanced query retrieval.

* **💬🤖 [Context-Aware Chatbot Using RAG Framework](https://github.com/Jakee4488/CustomGPT-RAG)**: A context-aware chatbot built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, leveraging state-of-the-art large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama 
  
* **📊 [Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Financial Markets](https://github.com/Jakee4488/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis)**: A production-ready Flask application that analyses real-time tweets from top financial influencers and institutions using advanced NLP
sentiment analysis. Track market sentiment, identify trends, and visualize financial opinions with an interactive dashboard.
